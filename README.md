# Anlysis of clay amplificators

About
-----
This is a MIR (Music Information Retrieval) project that aims to analyze the sound producted by 3 diferent clay amplificators.

In this work, white noises produced by a smartphone were recorded, which was inside the amplifiers.

From the recorded sound, some information was extracted from each audio.

This is the setup to record the white noises (enjoy this art! :D)

By the wave and the frequences x time matrix we can't se difference between the amplifiers

By the RMS descriptor we can see that amplifiers with open tip have a higher RMS value (the 0 reffers to the white noise without any amplifier)

We can put it in to mean X standard_deviation graph to see it better
